Rock Paper Scissors game
the player enters choice in prompt
while loop runs through 5 times
still need to declare a match winner (best of 5, first to 3)
winner of each round declared in console
would love insight and feedback on code 
while loop - runs until 5 total points would love to delay this - thought of do-while , or other solutions?
